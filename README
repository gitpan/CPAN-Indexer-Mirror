NAME
    CPAN::Indexer::Mirror - Creates the mirror.yml and mirror.json files

SYNOPSIS
      use CPAN::Indexer::Mirror ();
  
      CPAN::Indexer::Mirror->new(
          root => '/cpan/root/directory',
      )->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used to implement a small piece of functionality inside
    the CPAN/PAUSE indexer which generates mirror.yml and mirror.json.

    These files are used to allow CPAN clients (via the Mirror::YAML or
    Mirror::JSON modules) to implement mirror validation and automated
    selection.

METHODS
    Anyone who needs to know more detail than the SYNOPSIS should read the
    (fairly straight forward) code.

SUPPORT
    Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=CPAN-Indexer-Mirror>
